Chapter 5 - Classification - Detecting Poor Answers
===================================================

The book chapter is based on StackExchange's data blob from August 2012:

After publishing the book, StackExchange stayed as awesome as it always has been and released an updated version:
[http://www.clearbits.net/get/2155-sept-2013.torrent](http://www.clearbits.net/get/2155-sept-2013.torrent)

Note that using the latest version, you will get slightly different results.

The code is using pyenchant for spell correction. Pyenchent is only used to increase your pleasure of eperimenting with additional features. It is not used later on the chapter. So, if you find out that your platform poses too big problems to install it (e.g. on 64bit Windows), don't bother.
